vimPersonal
=========

vimPersonal is the personal Vim package of me, [Ian Mouzon](https://github.com/imouzon).
I am a graduate student studying statistics at Iowa State University. 
I have been using Vim since 2011 and have been slowly gathering a set of functions
that I find useful in my day to day work. Some of them are very general and have
inevitably been culled and later modified from various sources on the web, but
most of them have been written to solve specific problems I have been having 
and may be of no use to anyone else.

Quick Start
-----------

I use a package manager, and I hope you do as well. 
My Vim experience can be divided roughly into before and after I began using pathogen.
I use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) now, 
but the following instructions are pretty generalizable.
You can add vimPersonal to Vim simply by adding the following to your `.vimrc`.

    " Track the engine.
    Bundle 'imouzon/vimPersonal'

There will be very little documentation for most of vimPersonal for the foreseeable future.
